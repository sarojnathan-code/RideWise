Project Requirements
A. Functional Requirements
Register Riders

Register Drivers

Show available drivers

Request a ride

Match ride to driver using a strategy

Calculate fare using a pricing strategy

Track ride status:

REQUESTED

ASSIGNED

COMPLETED

CANCELLED

B. Non-Functional Requirements
Easily extendable pricing algorithm

Easily change driver matching logic

Low coupling between services

Maintainable and readable code

C. Domain Entities
Package → model/

Core Classes

D. Strategy & Composition Design
1. Ride Matching Strategy
public interface RideMatchingStrategy {

Driver findDriver(Rider rider, List<Driver> drivers);

}

Implementations:

NearestDriverStrategy

LeastActiveDriverStrategy

2. Fare Calculation Strategy
public interface FareStrategy {

double calculateFare(Ride ride);

}

Implementations:

DefaultFareStrategy

PeakHourFareStrategy

These strategies are injected into the RideService constructor.

This ensures:

DIP compliance

OCP compliance

Composition over inheritance

E. Service Layer
Package → service/

RiderService
Register riders

Get rider by ID

DriverService
Register drivers

Update availability

List available drivers

RideService
Request a ride

Assign driver using RideMatchingStrategy

Calculate fare using FareStrategy

Complete ride

F. Console Application (Menu)
Main menu in Main.java:

Add Rider

Add Driver

View Available Drivers

Request Ride

Complete Ride

View Rides

Exit

Each option must:

Use service-layer only

Catch invalid input

Avoid tightly-coupled logic
